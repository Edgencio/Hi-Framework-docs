<description>Let's build, deploy and test your first Hi app</description>

## Build the web app
This step generally comprehends the generation of a __WAR__ archive to be deployed to a container.
If you are not using an IDE, then you can just use the __mvn package__ command.


## Deployment
This step depends entirely on the container your are using, but it generally means to submit the result of the build (WAR) to the container.



## Run
Running your app is as easy as accessing __hello/world__ under the deployed context-path. <br>Example: __http://localhost:8080/&lt;context-path&gt;/hello/world__.
